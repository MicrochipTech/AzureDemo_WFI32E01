# Development Tools Installation for the Microchip WFI32E01 Certified Module

## Install Software Required for the Host Computer

1. Microchip `MPLAB X` tool chain for embedded code development on 32-bit architecture MCU/MPU platforms (made up of 3 major components)

    - [MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide) (when prompted, enable the installation of the [MPLAB IPE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/production/mplab-integrated-programming-environment) too)
        
        NOTE: This demonstration project was last tested successfully with MPLAB X **v6.05**. If a previous version of the IDE is needed, download it from the [MPLAB Development Ecosystem Downloads Archive](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/archives/mplab-ecosystem) (to fall back to the version Microchip successfully tested prior to release). 

    - [MPLAB XC32 Compiler](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-xc-compilers#tabs)

        NOTE: This demonstration project was tested successfully with XC32 **v4.10**, and in general should work with later versions of the compiler as they become available. If you encounter issues building the project with a newer version of the compiler, it is recommended to download the compiler version that was last tested successfully from the [MPLAB Development Ecosystem Downloads Archive](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/archives/mplab-ecosystem) (to fall back to the version Microchip successfully tested prior to release). 

     - [MPLAB Harmony Software Framework](https://microchipdeveloper.com/harmony3:mhc-overview)

2. [Git](https://git-scm.com) (a free and open source distributed version control system)

- Download/install the latest version ofÂ [Git for Windows, macOS, or Linux](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

- Verify working operation of the `Git Bash` prompt (e.g. for Windows: click `Start` > type `Git Bash`)

3. Any [Terminal Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators) program of your choice

## Additional Hardware Requirements for the PIC32 WFI32E Curiosity Board

If using the [PIC32 WFI32E Curiosity](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV12F11A) board, a [USB-to-UART converter](https://www.newark.com/c/cable-wire-cable-assemblies/cable-assemblies/usb-adapter-cables?conversion-type=usb-to-uart-converter) needs to be connected to the U1RX & U1TX pins of the GPIO Header (J207)

NOTE: In order to enable the on-board analog temperature sensor, the jumper J209 (TEMP SENSE) must be shorted
